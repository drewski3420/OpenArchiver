# EML Import

OpenArchiver allows you to import EML files from a zip archive. This is useful for importing emails from a variety of sources, including other email clients and services.

## Preparing the Zip File

To ensure a successful import, you should compress your .eml files to one zip file according to the following guidelines:

-   **Structure:** The zip file can contain any number of `.eml` files, organized in any folder structure. The folder structure will be preserved in OpenArchiver, so you can use it to organize your emails.
-   **Compression:** The zip file should be compressed using standard zip compression.

Here's an example of a valid folder structure:

```
archive.zip
├── inbox
│   ├── email-01.eml
│   └── email-02.eml
├── sent
│   └── email-03.eml
└── drafts
    ├── nested-folder
    │   └── email-04.eml
    └── email-05.eml
```

## Creating an EML Ingestion Source

1.  Go to the **Ingestion Sources** page in the OpenArchiver dashboard.
2.  Click the **Create New** button.
3.  Select **EML Import** as the provider.
4.  Enter a name for the ingestion source.
5.  Click the **Choose File** button and select the zip archive containing your EML files.
6.  Click the **Submit** button.

OpenArchiver will then start importing the EML files from the zip archive. The ingestion process may take some time, depending on the size of the archive.

# IAM Policies Guide

This document provides a comprehensive guide to the Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies in Open Archiver. Our policy structure is inspired by AWS IAM, providing a powerful and flexible way to manage permissions.

## 1. Policy Structure

A policy is a JSON object that consists of one or more statements. Each statement includes an `Effect`, `Action`, and `Resource`.

```json
{
	"Effect": "Allow",
	"Action": ["archive:read", "archive:search"],
	"Resource": ["archive/all"]
}
```

- **`Effect`**: Specifies whether the statement results in an `Allow` or `Deny`. An explicit `Deny` always overrides an `Allow`.
- **`Action`**: A list of operations that the policy grants or denies permission to perform. Actions are formatted as `service:operation`.
- **`Resource`**: A list of resources to which the actions apply. Resources are specified in a hierarchical format. Wildcards (`*`) can be used.

## 2. Wildcard Support

Our IAM system supports wildcards (`*`) in both `Action` and `Resource` fields to provide flexible permission management, as defined in the `PolicyValidator`.

### Action Wildcards

You can use wildcards to grant broad permissions for actions:

- **Global Wildcard (`*`)**: A standalone `*` in the `Action` field grants permission for all possible actions across all services.
    ```json
    "Action": ["*"]
    ```
- **Service-Level Wildcard (`service:*`)**: A wildcard at the end of an action string grants permission for all actions within that specific service.
    ```json
    "Action": ["archive:*"]
    ```

### Resource Wildcards

Wildcards can also be used to specify resources:

- **Global Wildcard (`*`)**: A standalone `*` in the `Resource` field applies the policy to all resources in the system.
    ```json
    "Resource": ["*"]
    ```
- **Partial Wildcards**: Some services allow wildcards at specific points in the resource path to refer to all resources of a certain type. For example, to target all ingestion sources:
    ```json
    "Resource": ["ingestion-source/*"]
    ```

## 3. Actions and Resources by Service
